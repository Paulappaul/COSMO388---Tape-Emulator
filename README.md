Cosmo 388 is the first DAW from Simulacra Sound. This fully functional workstation is designed to replicate the legendary Tascam 388 reel-to-reel tape machine. With its 8 channels for recording and playback, animated VU meters, and lifelike reel-to-reel movement, Cosmo 388 immerses you in the world of authentic analog recording.

Through advanced convolution techniques, this powerful DAW faithfully captures the warmth, saturation, and dynamic response of an analog tape machine. As you play, record, and mix your music, Cosmo 388 reacts dynamically to your input signal's amplitude, just like a genuine tape machine would.

Designed with simplicity in mind, Cosmo 388 is a perfect choice for musicians at any level. Whether you're a beginner, intimidated by the complexities of professional DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic, or Ableton, or a seasoned musician seeking a streamlined workflow, Cosmo 388 delivers a user-friendly interface that empowers you to quickly record and produce your music.

With two dedicated send dials for Reverb and Tape Saturation, Cosmo 388 offers effortless control over the depth and character of your sound. The immersive, out-of-the-box experience ensures that your recordings sound incredible from the moment you hit the play button.
